 Introduction

The Pomodoro Timer API serves as a digital productivity tool designed to help users manage work and break intervals effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The API offers functionality for customizing, initiating, pausing, and resetting timers. It also allows users to track productivity over multiple sessions and provides data logging capabilities for better session analysis.

 Background/Context

Time management is a crucial skill for productivity and focus, and the Pomodoro Technique is a proven method to enhance concentration. With this API, users can customize their work intervals (Pomodoro sessions) and break periods. The goal is to provide flexibility in time management while tracking user productivity for future improvements.

 Stakeholders

- Users: Individuals who use the Pomodoro Timer to structure their work intervals and breaks.
- Productivity Enthusiasts: Those seeking structured ways to enhance focus, reduce distractions, and optimize time management.

 Functional Requirements

1. Timer Management
   - The service should allow users to start, pause, reset, and stop a Pomodoro session.
   - The service should allow users to set the duration for both work sessions and breaks.
   - The service should store each session’s duration and allow for tracking of the total work time and break time.

2. Session Tracking
   - The service should provide endpoints to retrieve a user’s completed sessions, including work and break durations.
   - The service should allow users to track their progress over time, showing metrics such as the number of Pomodoro sessions completed.

3. Customization
   - Users should be able to adjust their work and break durations dynamically.
   - Users should have the ability to set long breaks (after a certain number of Pomodoro sessions).

4. Data Logging
   - The service should log each session, including start time, end time, and type (work or break).
   - The service should allow users to retrieve a log of all completed sessions.

5. Authentication and Authorization
   - The service should require authentication to create, update, or delete timer settings or session logs.
   - Users should be able to track their own sessions and modify their personal settings.

6. Error Handling
   - The API should return appropriate error codes for failed operations (e.g., `400 Bad Request` for invalid session times).

 Use Case Description

 Timer Management
- Create (POST):  
  - As a user, I want to start a new Pomodoro session with a specified work duration so I can begin working in intervals.
  
- Read (GET):  
  - As a user, I want to retrieve the current Pomodoro session’s status (work or break) and time remaining.

- Update (PUT):  
  - As a user, I want to adjust the work or break durations for my next session.

- Delete (DELETE):  
  - As a user, I want to stop a session and reset the timer to its initial state.

 Session Tracking
- Create (POST):  
  - As a user, I want to log the time spent in each Pomodoro session, including work and break times.

- Read (GET):  
  - As a user, I want to see my session history to track the amount of time spent working and taking breaks.

 Customization
- Create (POST):  
  - As a user, I want to create customized work and break durations.

- Update (PUT):  
  - As a user, I want to change my preferred work and break durations based on my needs.

 Error Handling
- Validation Errors:  
  - Respond with `400 Bad Request` and include the error details.

- Authentication Errors:  
  - Use `401 Unauthorized` for authentication issues and `403 Forbidden` for authorization issues.

 List of Resources
- Timer: Represents a Pomodoro session (either work or break).
- Session Log: Tracks the history of completed Pomodoro sessions, including durations.

 Endpoints

 Timers
- POST `/api/timers`
  - Description: Start a new Pomodoro session.
  - Request BODY: `{"workDuration": 25, "breakDuration": 5}`
  - Response: `201 Created` with the new timer details.

- GET `/api/timers`
  - Description: Get the current timer status and remaining time.
  - Response: `200 OK` with the timer status.

- PUT `/api/timers`
  - Description: Update the current session’s duration.
  - Request BODY: `{"workDuration": 30, "breakDuration": 10}`
  - Response: `200 OK` with the updated timer details.

- DELETE `/api/timers`
  - Description: Stop and reset the timer.
  - Response: `204 No Content`.

 Session Logs
- POST `/api/sessions`
  - Description: Log a completed Pomodoro session.
  - Request BODY: `{"sessionType": "work", "duration": 25}`
  - Response: `201 Created` with the session log details.

- GET `/api/sessions`
  - Description: Retrieve all completed Pomodoro sessions.
  - Response: `200 OK` with an array of session logs.

 Error Handling Strategies
- Validation Errors: Respond with `400 Bad Request` and include the error details.
- Authentication Errors: Utilize `401 Unauthorized` and `403 Forbidden` for authentication issues.
- Server Errors: Respond with `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected server-side issues.

 UML Diagrams

Below is the UML structure for your Pomodoro Timer API. It is simplified and represents the key components: `Timer`, `SessionLog`, and `User`.

Timer
- Attributes: `id`, `workDuration`, `breakDuration`, `status`
- Operations: `start()`, `pause()`, `reset()`, `getStatus()`

SessionLog
- Attributes: `id`, `sessionType`, `duration`, `timestamp`
- Operations: `logSession()`, `getSessionHistory()`

User
- Attributes: `id`, `username`, `password`, `email`
- Operations: `authenticate()`, `createTimer()`, `viewSessionHistory()`
